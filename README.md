# README

These files are Supplementary Data for "Evolution of Fullerenes in Circumstellar Envelopes by Carbon Condensation: Insights from Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations".

The files include an example of the LAMMPS input script that was used in our study, along with the corresponding simulation outputs.

The files in the path "./Adsorption/ "are used to simulate the adsorption process of C2 and H by C60, including the input script (in), input data (addMole, potential_file) and output data (remodeldata, OUT, XYZ, XYZ2) of LAMMPS.

Then, the files in the path "./Transition/ "are the files used to simulate the transformation reaction process of the initial cluster structure formed by adsorption. This includes the input script (in), input data (Datafile, potential_file), and output data (remodeldata, OUT, XYZ, XYZ2) of the LAMMPS.
